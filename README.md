# loopback4-sequelize

[![LoopBack](<https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-next/raw/master/docs/site/imgs/branding/Powered-by-LoopBack-Badge-(blue)-@2x.png>)](http://loopback.io/)

This is a loopback4 extension that provides Sequelize's query builder at repository level in any loopback 4 application. It has zero learning curve as it follows the same interface as `DefaultCrudRepository`. For relational databases, Sequelize is a popular ORM of choice.

For pending features, refer to the [Limitations](#limitations) section below.

## Installation

```sh
npm install loopback4-sequelize
```

## Usage

> You can watch a video demo of this extension by [clicking here](https://youtu.be/tHg5ZAj29YQ).

Both newly developed and existing projects can benefit from the extension. By just changing the parent classes in the target Data Source and Repositories.

### Step 1: Configure DataSource

Change the parent class from `juggler.DataSource` to `SequelizeDataSource` like below.

```ts
// ...
import {SequelizeDataSource} from 'loopback4-sequelize';

// ...
export class PgDataSource
  extends SequelizeDataSource
  implements LifeCycleObserver {
  // ...
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Repository

Change the parent class from `DefaultCrudRepository` to `SequelizeRepository` like below.

```ts
// ...
import {SequelizeRepository} from 'loopback4-sequelize';

export class YourRepository extends SequelizeRepository<
  YourModel,
  typeof YourModel.prototype.id,
  YourModelRelations
> {
  // ...
}
```

## Limitations

Please note, the current implementation does not support the following:

1. Relational Query Support (currently only basic CRUD is supported with loopback style filters).
2. SQL Transactions.
3. Sequelize Powered Migrations.

Community contribution is welcome.
